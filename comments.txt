Comments:
a coment is simply a piece of code that is not executed by the interpreter and we use them to document the code.



Types of Python Comments

In Python there are two types of comments- Single line comments and Multiple lines comments. Single line commenting is commonly used for a brief and quick comment (or to debug a program, we will see it later). On the other hand we use the Multiple lines comments to note down something much more in details or to block out an entire chunk of code.
Single Line Comments

In Python for single line comments use # sign to comment out everything following it on that line.

#this is a comment
myVar = "hello comments" # a variable containing something
print(myVar) #print statement to print contents of a variable
Multiple Lines Comments
Multiple lines comments are slightly different. 
Simply use 3 single quotes before and after the part you want to be commented.

'''
print("I am in Multiple line comment line 1")
print ("I am in Multiple line comment line 2")
'''
print("I am out of Multiple line comment")
